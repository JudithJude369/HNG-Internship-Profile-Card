## Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the HNG Frontend Intern Task. The task involved creating a profile card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display specific personal and real-time data attributes. Each required element had a specified data-testid attribute for easy identification and testing.

## Task Description

The task requirements were as follows:

- Display Full Name.
- Showcase the  profile picture.
- Indicate Job Title.
- Write a Short Bio.
- Provide Email Address
- Display the current UTC time .
- Mention the Current Location.
- Provide a clickable link to my Social Media Link.

## Implementation

To fulfill the task requirements, I followed these steps:

1. **HTML Structure:** I created the basic structure of the web page using HTML, including all the required elements with their respective data-testid attributes.

2. **CSS Styling:** I applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the page. The styling included backgrounds, fonts, colors, and responsive design for better user experience.

3. **JavaScript for Real-Time Data:** I used JavaScript to dynamically update the current date and  UTC time. I also added a function to handle errors, such as missing profile pictures or LinkedIn URLs.

4. **GitHub Hosting:** I hosted the web page on GitHub Pages, making it accessible via the URL

6. **Testing:** I tested the page thoroughly to ensure that all elements were displayed correctly, real-time data updated as expected, and error handling worked as intended. I used the data-testid attributes for testing.

## Error Handling

Error handling was implemented to improve user experience:

- **Missing Profile Picture:** If the profile picture is missing, the code displays the profile picture no matter what and provides a default alt text for accessibility.

- **Missing LinkedIn URL:** If the LinkedIn URL is not found, the code displays an error message and removes the link to prevent broken links.

## Testing

To ensure the functionality and correctness of the web page, I performed testing by:

- Checking that all elements were displayed as specified in the task description.

- Verifying that the current date and UTC time were updated in real-time.
